### Hi, I'm Diego 👋

### I'm a software engineer working at Shopify 🛍

👷🏻‍♂️ I’m currently building using Ruby on Rails and GraphQL, focusing on back end development

🤙 My number one value: KISS

🤔 I'm mostly interested in sofware pieces and concepts related to payments and transactions

🌱 Currently learning how to write better technical documentation and articles

🏴‍☠️ Fun fact: My handle is CaptainDiego because I am a ship officer by trade 🚢
